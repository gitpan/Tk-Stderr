NAME
    Tk::Stderr - capture standard error output, display in separate window

SYNOPSIS
    use Tk::Stderr;

    $mw = MainWindow->new->InitStderr;
    print STDERR 'stuff';   ## goes to standard error window
    warn 'eek!';            ## likewise

DESCRIPTION
    This module captures that standard error of a program and redirects it
    to a read only text widget, which doesn't appear until necessary. When
    it does appear, the user can close it; it'll appear again when there is
    more output.

INSTALLATION

    To install this module type the following:

       perl Makefile.PL
       make
       make test
       make install

CHANGES

    Version 1.1 just adds a dependency for Tk in the Makefile.PL file.

    Version 1.2 adds the RedirectStderr method to allow redirection
    to be turned on and off during the execution of a program.
